# Lecture 1

## Static Typing vs Dynamic Typing

- Java is a type-safe language, very strict in type-checking

## i/o

- java DiscCoverage < data.in > data.out (results are added to a new file)

## Composite Data: Array

## Disc Coverage Problem

- Find the number of points covering a unit disc centered at each point

## Mental Modeling

- Establish a mental model that is correct, consistent and complete

## Stack vs Heap memory

- Stack
  - special region in computer's memory that stores temp variables created by each function (last in, first out)
- Heap
  - region of computer memory not managed automatically for you
  - is not as tightly managed by the cpu
  - free floating region of memory

## Homework: Imperative solution disc coverage

## Abstraction barrier

- Separation between implementer and client
  - implementer dfines the data/functinoal abstractions
  - client uses the high level data type and methods
- Must facilitate communication across the barrier
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
  - Package related data and behaviour
  - hide information/data from the client
  - Mutation should be done through methods only
